## Tips and how to use: 

An internet connection is required to use this program. All you have to do is click the panel to hear the desired chord. The better the internet connection, the faster the response will be. If you get little to no response, or the panel freeezes gray when you click it without producing sound, it's likely your internet connection is too weak or there is too much traffic on your network (i.e. LewiWifi in the library during finals week -___-) 

You don't really need to know much about music theory, just pick the chords that sound good to you! You'll find that some chords are sounding a bit muddy/dissonant. You're most likely playing Alt. Dominant chords. 

In music, dominant chords are used to go "home" to major chords. So, we put a lot of dissonance on these chords to make the resolution much more satisfying. Try this: 


Find and click the F Alt. panel. Pretty ugly right? Now, pause for a few seconds to let your ears readjust. Now, play the C Min. 9 panel. Now, play the F Alt. panel. And lastly, play the Bb Major 9 panel. Wasn't that pretty? 


There are 12 main keys in music, and in each key there are 7 notes. You can build chords on each note, which is where chords come from. The series of chords you just played is called a ii-V-I chord progression, which is very common in jazz and a lot of music dating back to even Medieval chants. There are many different kinds of progressions, too many to list, all being ideal based on how the chord is being played. For now, I've only listed the ii-V-I progression. Below, you'll find the ii-V-I progression in all 12 keys, see which one you like the most! 


Sidenote: You'll notice that I have chords below called "X Sus 13". I won't get too into detail about these chords, just know that they can be used as dominant chords as well. Whenever you see a dominant chord, try to subsitute it with a suspended chord and see how you like it!



## ii-V-I: 


**C: D Min. --- G Dom. --- C Maj.**


**F: G Min. --- C Dom. --- F Maj.** 


**Bb: C Min. --- F Dom. --- Bb Maj.** 


**Eb: F Min. --- Bb Dom. --- Eb Maj.** 


**Ab: Bb Min. --- Eb Dom. --- Ab Maj.** 


**Db: Eb Min. --- Ab Dom. --- Db Maj.** 


**Gb: Ab Min. --- Db Dom. --- Gb Maj.**


**B: Db Min.(C# Min.) --- Gb Dom.(F# Dom.) --- B Maj.** 


**E: Gb Min.(F# Min.) --- B Dom. --- E Maj.** 


**A: B Min. --- E Dom. --- A Maj.** 


**D: E Min. --- A Dom. --- D Maj.** 


**G: A Min. --- D Dom. --- G Maj.** 



Now that you see that Dominant chords preceed major chords, see if you're able to substitute and mix chords/keys together to make for decent progressions. Use your ears. Here are some of my favorites. 


**F Min. - Bb Dom. - Eb Maj. - Ab Dom.** 


**E Min. - F Sus. - A Sus - D Maj.** 


**Ab Min. - Db Alt. - Gb Maj. - B Alt. - E Maj.** 


These are just a few that I came up with over time, using in songs, practice etc. But you'll see there are many more than ii-V-I's, even being able to mix and match chords.
